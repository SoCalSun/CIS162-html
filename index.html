    <h1>David Hall</h1>
    <p> Welcome to my webpage all about me, <em>David Hall</em>! Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by three
        things: the military, cars, and computers. After high school, I spent a few years living abroad. When I came back,
        I joined the Air Force and served for ten years, separating on Thanksgiving Day, 2016. Not long after, I became
        a mechanic and have been working in that field ever since.</p>

    <p>I lived on the East Coast for the past 15 years, but I moved back home in February of this year. I left my management
        career in Maryland to dive into my third passion: computers. During my time in the military, I got a taste of information
        technology, but it wasn’t my main job. Now, I’m enrolled in a computer programming certificate program and loving
        it so far. I enjoy challenging work, creating things, and solving problems, which I believe this new career will offer.</p>
