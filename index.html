        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my webpage all about me, <em>David Hall</em>! Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by three
            things: the military, cars, and computers. After high school, I spent a few years living abroad. When I came back,
            I joined the Air Force and served for ten years, separating on Thanksgiving Day, 2016. Not long after, I became
            a mechanic and have been working in that field ever since.
        </p>

        <p>
            I lived on the East Coast for the past 15 years, but I moved back home in February of this year. I left my management
            career in Maryland to dive into my third passion: computers. During my time in the military, I got a taste of information
            technology, but it wasn’t my main job. Now, I’m enrolled in a computer programming certificate program and loving
            it so far. I enjoy challenging work, creating things, and solving problems, which I believe this new career will offer.
        </p>
